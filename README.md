# VidRand
Personal Project (Web app) to learn and use the following:
- WebSockets
- "Advanced" Angular features (architecture/multiple modules, route guards, resolvers etc.)
- Design Patterns (backend will be Java w/ Spring Boot & PostgreSQL)
- Spring Security & Spring Batch
- Microservices architecture
- Lombok
- Google Adsense & Google Analytics
- Extra: general performance optimization for scalability + perfect 100 score on Google Lighthouse

The gist of the functionality: Like omegle where you connect with a random person and then both persons have to each choose a Youtube vid (under 2 minutes) which they'll both have to watch at the same time, and of course they can use text/voice chat while watching.
